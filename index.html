            Hi, I'm CJ. I'm a Senior and Masters Computer Science student at 
            Virginia Tech with a Music Technology minor. I'm interested in front-end development and design as well as
            software engineering and development. My recent work has been focused on ways that I can combine computer science
            with my creative interests in design and music to make projects that allow me to express myself in new ways.
            This website has a compilation of projects that I have completed throughout variety of classes during my 
            time here at Virginia Tech ranging from Music classes to Computer Science programs.

            <h2>Country Music is Dying... Fast</h2>
          </a>
          <p class="description">
            Can today's "country music" really be classified as country? That's what I'm here to 
            talk about in Country Music is Dying... Fast.
            Today's "country music" isn't even close to the good old traditional country music
            that it tries to mimic. The values, sounds, and meaning that used to exist in country music
            is no longer present. So then how would today's music even be able to call itself country. 
            In my opinion, it can't. Now we have pop, rock, folk, etc., and it seems like country is nowhere
            to be found. So how much longer does it have?

            What is the Mona Lisa of video games?
            How are video games considered art? These are
            questions that we dive into when discussing one of our favorite hobbies and pastimes.
            In our podcast, we discuss the two games <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> 
            and <i>The Outer Wilds.</i> We delve into what makes these games amazing and how they 
            utilize elements of gameplay as a medium, so the user can have an experience that can 
            be called an artform.

            Here's a link to a soundcloud playlist that features a compliation of some of the assignments I completed for my music courses.
            The last song on the list is a song called <i>Waves</i> that I wrote for my final project for the class. The last two songs are
            mixes I've made my Audio Tech classes using audio files from an open source website.

            Here's a link to a Git Repository for a day trading program myself and one of my friends have been working on for the past few years.
            It's still a work in progress but there is a great foundation that we were able to create and test using good coding practice and
            knowledge of the stock market. It's been a great outlet to work on in my free time when I don't have classwork to complete.
