            Hi, I'm CJ! I'm a sophomore Computer Science student at 
            Virginia tech with a Music minor. I love Country Music and play the guitar. 
            I also like to play video games, and I'm a huge Star Wars fan. Here's a little
            showcase of some of the work that I've produced for my writing and digital media
            class.

            Can today's "country music" really be classified as country? That's what I'm here to 
            talk about in Country Music is Dying... Fast.
            Today's "country music" isn't even close to the good old traditional country music
            that it tries to mimic. The values, sounds, and meaning that used to exist in country music
            is no longer present. So then how would today's music even be able to call itself country. 
            In my opinion, it can't. Now we have pop, rock, folk, etc., and it seems like country is nowhere
            to be found. So how much longer does it have?

            What is the Mona Lisa of video games?
            How are video games considered art? These are
            questions that we dive into when discussing one of our favorite hobbies and pastimes.
            In our podcast, we discuss the two games <i>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</i> 
            and <i>The Outer Wilds.</i> We delve into what makes these games amazing and how they 
            utilize elements of gameplay as a medium, so the user can have an experience that can 
            be called an artform.
